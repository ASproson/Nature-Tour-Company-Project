# Nature Tour Company Project
A product website I created for a fictional nature tour company

## Introduction
In this project I focused on trying to create a responsive website whilst using a mix of flexbox and grid layouts.

### Technology
HTML and CSS were used for this project, written in Atom.

### Comments
The website isn't fully accessible, I would likely need to create an opactiy layer behind the white/black text to make it easier to read. The website is also responsive to a point and then starts breaking, I would need to add further media queries to support mobiles better.
